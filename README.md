# Flipkart-Price-Tracker

Flipkart Price Notifier is a Python-based application that allows users to track the prices of products on Flipkart, an e-commerce platform. The application enables users to set a desired price for a specific product and receive an email notification when the product's price falls below the set threshold.

Main Features:
- Price Tracking: Users can paste the URL of a product on Flipkart and set their desired price for that product.
- Email Notification: When the product's price drops below the desired amount, the application sends an email alert to the user.
- Highlights (Optional): The application can also fetch and include product highlights or details in the notification email.
- User Interface: The application offers a simple and user-friendly interface using the tkinter library for ease of use.

This project is useful for anyone who wants to keep track of product prices on Flipkart and grab the best deals when the prices drop within their budget.
